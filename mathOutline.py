#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

a = ("Packers" + "Lafleur") 
print(a)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

b = 9 + 9
print(b)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
c = 30 - 19 
print(c)


#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
d = 2.1 - 1.1print(d)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

e = 4 * 3 print(e)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

f = "done" * 6
print(f)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

g = 16 / 4
print(g)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

h = 16.2/16.05
print(h)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

i = 2 % 5
print(i)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

j = 30 // 5
print(j)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

k = 4 ** 5 
print(k)
